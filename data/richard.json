Nudge, on the other hand, is a softer push towards a desired outcome. It's less intrusive and provides extra information in a structured way to motivate users to take a particular action."

      "1/ Interesting snippet on the @theAllInPod by @friedberg: \"Typically those products that are easier paths to market end up being features. They don't end up being platforms, so it's very hard to become a big business ... or differentiate in a competitive market.\"",
      "Looking forward to speaking about decentralized AI (and hopeful futures) alongside @EMostaque @ilblackdragon and the rest of this impressive lineup later this week. You can tune in online too. [link]",

      "1/ AI Legos. One key feature that Web3 can offer AI is composability. Current AI models & APIs are difficult to build on and monetize. Centralized API tokens & compute tokens are not interoperable across services.",
      "Imagine an economy that forms around the AI app supply chain. What if we can unbundle AI app building so that the user app, the large language model, and the compute are provided by different organizations/individuals? Lower friction, increased decentralization => more creators.",
      "New term I learned recently: Simulation Intelligence (SI) - The blending of computational simulations & intelligence. In AI, we need to start thinking less about individual models & more about systems/workflows. Here's an example for molecule discovery. [link]",
      "1/ Just came across TurKit, a scripting language for crowdsourcing Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs). DAOs are just human computation algorithms. https://t.co/WcESo1yBlm",
      "The veil of crypto is greed and fomo. The first profiles you follow on Twitter are traders. Get past it. Underneath is incredible energy, collaboration and open source ethos. Once you experience it, you'll never be the same again. You might even quit your job.",
